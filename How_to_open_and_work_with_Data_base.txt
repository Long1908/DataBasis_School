After Installing we can create a file
We click on 'File' from the Menu bar->We expand the 'Data 'source' -> then we click on
'IBM Db2'

From here we put the parameters for the DB2 server:
	1)On the 'Name' line and field we write 'DB2'
	2)Under 'General' on the 'Connection type' we select 'Type4' and on Driver we select
'IBM Db2'
	3)On 'Host' we write '62.44.108.24'
	4)On 'Port' we write '50000'
	5)On 'User' we write 'db2admin'
	6)On 'Password' we write db2admin
	7)On 'Database' we write 'SAMPLE'
	8)and then we click on 'Test Connection'.
If everything goes well after step 8) we should be good to go and hit 'Apply' and 'Ok'

Now afterwards we are ready to create are new file that we are going to work with
Again we hit 'File' from the menu bar -> we expand 'New' -> We click on 'SQL File'

When our SQL file is created we need to choose our session:
On the '<session>' bar we need to expand it and then we click on 'DB2' and then we click on
'console'

After that we have to choose our scheme. If we are given the option to click on 
'Introspect schema' we click on it.

(Sometimes that might not work at first, so we need to refresh)

After everything is done we should be able to write SQL.
